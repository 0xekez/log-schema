LogSchema
=================================

A Zeek package for printing the format of Zeek's logs using the [JSON
Schema](https://json-schema.org/) format.

## Installation

Clone this repository and then run `zkg install .`. For instructions
on getting `zkg` see the Zeek package manager
[documentation](https://packages.zeek.org/).

## Usage

```
zeek <whatever scripts you normally load> log-schema
```

For example, if my typical Zeek invocation looked like `zeek
interesting-logs.zeek` to dump the JSON Schema of the logs that
invocation will create I would run `zeek interesting-logs.zeek
log-schema`.

## How it works

A low priority `zeek_init` event is registered which iterates over
[`Log::active_streams`](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/scripts/base/frameworks/logging/main.zeek.html?highlight=active_streams#id-Log::active_streams)
, seriaizes them to JSON, writes them to standard out, and then calls
[`terminate()`](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/scripts/base/bif/zeek.bif.zeek.html?highlight=terminate#id-terminate).

## Using your own schema format

Redefine `LogSchema::log_handler` with your own handler function. For
example, to print only the number of log streams present:

```zeek
redef LogSchema::log_handler = function(streams: vector of Log::Stream)
	{
	print |streams|;
	};
```

Note that there is no requirement that the logs are printed to
standard out.
